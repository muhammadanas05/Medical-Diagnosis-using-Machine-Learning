# Medical Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to diagnose medical conditions based on patient symptoms and historical medical data. The goal is to implement and evaluate various classification techniques to accurately predict medical conditions.

## Project Structure

This folder contains the following files:

- `Task_02.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
- `app.py`: The Flask backend file for serving the model and handling API requests.
- `index.html`: The HTML file for the frontend user interface.
- `healthcare_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Task Description

### Objectives

1. Dataset Collection: Collected a dataset containing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnosed medical conditions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and preprocessed the data for model training.
3. Model Implementation: Implemented classification models using techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Additional Challenges

1. Feature Engineering: Applied techniques to extract relevant features from the medical data to improve model performance.
2. Handling Imbalanced Classes: Addressed class imbalance issues in the dataset to ensure reliable model predictions.

### Frontend and Backend

- Frontend: Developed a user interface using HTML and JavaScript to interact with the machine learning model.
- Backend: Created a Flask-based backend to handle requests and serve predictions from the model.

## How to Run

1. Setup Environment: Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run Backend: Start the Flask server by executing `python app.py`.
3. Open Frontend: Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the user interface.
