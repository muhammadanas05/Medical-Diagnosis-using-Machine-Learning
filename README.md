# Medical Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to diagnose medical conditions based on patient symptoms and historical medical data. The goal is to implement and evaluate various classification techniques to accurately predict medical conditions.

### Objectives

1. Dataset Collection: Collected a dataset containing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnosed medical conditions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and preprocessed the data for model training.
3. Model Implementation: Implemented classification models using techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Additional Challenges

1. Feature Engineering: Applied techniques to extract relevant features from the medical data to improve model performance.
2. Handling Imbalanced Classes: Addressed class imbalance issues in the dataset to ensure reliable model predictions.
